tupple is similar to list  but immutable

** is exponenet in python

there is no character datatype in python

string we can get character by charcter using [] bracket for ex string[1]
howerver since string in immutable we cannout use assignment operator

two compare two list we can compares using ==

Dicitonary keys cannot be list because list is mutable and key in dictionary cannot be change
key can be string, tupple, int, float
Key are unique
Dictionary doesnt followu order therefore no concept of index

value in key can be itself a dicitonary

info.keys() will only give outermost key in nested dicitonary
info.values() will only give outermost values and nested dicitonary will be part of it within values
here info is name of nested dicitonary

put in java is replaced by update here
get method is used in both python and java


List and Dicitonary cannot be stored in Set because list and dicitonary are mutable

EmptySet can be reperesented as  info = set() # here info is name of set

list = [1,2,3] # to add element we use append method
tuple = (1,2,3,4)
map = { "key" : "value"}
set = {1,2,3} # to add element we use add method


Set is mutable but it is element are immutable there we can store list and map as element in Set

for loop has optional else which is only executed when loop is fully executed without break

pass is used as null stementent
